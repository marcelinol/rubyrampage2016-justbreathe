## Description

Just Breathe is a web app which allow you to create a meditation session where you and your colleagues can join to meditate synchronized. The user who creates the session defines the time that the meditation session will last and it starts and ends at the same time for all participants of the session.

### Origin

The idea came from @lucasalencar since we meditate in group at work and we use a not synchronized app. So, everytime someone is responsible for tell the others that the session ended.

We implemented the app during [Ruby Rampage](https://www.rubyrampage.com/) 2016 competition.
